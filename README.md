# About CEEW

The Council on Energy, Environment and Water is one of Asia’s leading not-for-profit policy research institutions. CEEW uses data, integrated analysis, and strategic outreach to explain – and change – the use, reuse, and misuse of resources.

# About Our Research

We worked as a Data Analyst Intern with Industrial Sustainability and Competitiveness team at CEEW under the mentorship of Tirtha Biswas, on a collection of secondary data and analysis for the ongoing research towards estimation of GHG emissions from the manufacturing sector and analyzing the trade between India and the ASEAN countries.

The Scripts are in the folder named "Tasks". Which contains all the .R files in thier specific folders.

Also, I have learned the hard way for organising the files with names and places but it was a great experience to learn a great amount of skills and insights.

PS. You will not find any output file/workspace for these codes here but only the scripts of #R-Language, as I beleive the data and its analysis can not be brought to public without permission. 
Thank you :).
